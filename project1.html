	<h1>ARTWORLD </h1>
	<hr>
	<P>Art expresses emotions or is an expression of life. Art is a creation that allows for interpretation of any kind. I have read that art is considered a human skill as opposed to nature, a skill applied to music, painting, poetry etc. I believe that nature is an art as well. If something is made by someone or by nature in a certain way, then it’s unique and special in its own way.</P>
	<p>Art is a creation through observation and interpretation of the art and the portrayal of their craft by the artist in whatever way they want whether it is viewed the same way as the observer or any way they see it. Intelligible and recognized thoughts and emotions of the world is considered to be art. Within the emotions and thoughts of the world, art enables those experiences to be intelligible and recognized.</p>

	<h4>”Art is your emotions flowing in a river of imagination”</h4>
	<p> Art is universal, and is everywhere. Not only art is for one who exercise a work art and like it. It is for everyone. Art is more important then one can consider. Without art one cannot see any thing beautiful because art add attraction and beauty to any thing one can look at, even if he look at himself. Also art reflects to us the mood and the feelings of the artist so that if he’s happy he will do something amazed or funny, and if he is upset he will use to do things which would hold you to another world of thinks. Some one said “Art is the only way to run away without leaving home”</p>
	<h4>Art is a form of work that is an expression of emotion. Craft is a form of work that results in a tangible production, for example, moulding and carving. Art is often described as unstructured and open-ended. Like painting, there is no limit to its expression. </h4>

	<P>Art is work with feelings and love. It is an activity where we can gain more ideas. On the other hand, the craft is an act where we have to use our hands and brain. For making crafts, we have to learn ideas and skills. It’s a work with tools and many other things.It is a field where there are many talented people arising. From ancient times, people have been conveying their messages in the form of art, whether it is a cave painting or something which today is called digital art. I think that the message we convey through a painting or drawing leaves a much deeper impression upon our minds and the impression often last much longer that other ways to convey idea, like by speaking or by writing. Craft in a field in art which usually involves making of something which is 3-dimensional. Art does not involve of learning or studying, but it is something which captures the eyes. So, to conclude, we must encourage art like music and studies.</P>
